### Description

**SeetaFace Engine** is an open source C++ face recognition engine, which can run on CPU with no third-party dependence. It contains three key parts, i.e., **SeetaFace Detection**, **SeetaFace Alignment** and **SeetaFace Identification**, which are necessary and sufficient for building a real-world face recognition applicaiton system. 

* SeetaFace Detection implements a funnel-structured (FuSt) cascade schema for real-time multi-view face detection, which achieves a good trade-off between detection accuracy and speed. State of the art accuracy can be achieved on the public dataset [FDDB](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/fddb/) in high speed. See [SeetaFace Detection](https://github.com/seetaface/SeetaFaceEngine/tree/master/FaceDetection) for more details. 

* SeetaFace Alignment cascades several stacked auto-encoder networks to detect landmarks in real time (more than 200 fps on a single I7 desktop CPU), and achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy at least on some public datasets [AFLW](http://lrs.icg.tugraz.at/research/aflw/). See [SeetaFace Alignment](https://github.com/seetaface/SeetaFaceEngine/tree/master/FaceAlignment) for more details. 

* SeetaFace Identification is a modification of AlexNet CNN for face recognition, with better performance in terms of both accuracy (97.1% on [LFW] (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) and speed (about 120ms on a single I7 desktop CPU). See [SeetaFace Identification](https://github.com/seetaface/SeetaFaceEngine/tree/master/FaceIdentification) for more details. 

This face recognition engine is developed by Visual Information Processing and Learning (VIPL) group, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The codes are written in C++ without dependence on any 3rd-party libraries. The open source is now released under BSD-2 license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details), which means the codes can be used freely for both acedemic purpose and industrial products.
